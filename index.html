        <h1>Sopes History</h1>
        <a>Sopes come from Central Mexico. They were originally called pellizcadas, which eventually got changed.</a>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cup of masa haria</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup of warm water</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons vegstable oil</li>
            <li>1 cup of refried beans</li>
            <li>2 cups of lettuce finely shredded</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup cooked beef or chicken shredded</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of Mexican cheese(queso fresco)crumbled</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white onion finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Mexican cream</li>
            <li>Spicy salsa of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions(Serves around 10 sopes)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix Masa harina and warm water in a medium sized bowl, and knead the dough until you have a uniform texture.</li>
                <li>If the dough feels dry, add more water, little by litte, until the dough is soft and managable, like play dough. It doesn't have to be sticky. Make sure the dough has enough moisture to avoid cracking on the sope's surface.</li>
                <li>Cover the dough with a wet kitchen towel; this will help to keep the dough moist. Keep a small bowl of water next to your working area to moisten your hands and dough.</li>
                <li>Divide the dough into 10 pieces of the same size, and cover with a clean kitchen towel.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Form the sope</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the griddle or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>To form the sope, cut the plastic bag into 2 squares of about 6' each. Place one piece of plastic on the Tortilla press , then put odwn one of the small balls of dough and cover it with the other piece of plastic.</li>
                    <li>Close the torillera and press down gently with the tortilla press handle until you form a medium size think torilla. About 4 1/2 in.</li>
                    <li>Lift the handle and temove the top plastic. Pick up the tortilla, holding it with the plastic at the bottom, and gently flip the tortilla into the palm of your hand. A large part of the tortilla will cover your hand.</li>
                    <li>Place the tortilla on the already hot griddle/comal; this is a fast but gentle move.</li>
                    <li>Turn the tortilla after a minute, don't let it cook longer, or the dough will dry and crack. Turn after a minute; the last cooking will take about 20-30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Cover the tortillas with a dry kitchen towel and allow them to cool for about 30-45 seconds, and start forming the border by pinching the edges with your fingers.</li>
                    <li>Now, the tortillas had become sopes, covered them again with the kitchen towel, and cook the rest of the sopes.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Serving the sopes</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li> Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat.</li>
                        <li>Place the sopes on the skillet and lightly fry them on both sides(about 30 seconds each side). They will be ready when they have a golden color. Remove the heat and place on a plate that has already been covered with paper towels to absorb any excess fat/oil.</li>
                        <li>Spread the refried beans and top with shredded lettuce, beef, chicken, or any other topping you choose.</li>
                    </ol>
